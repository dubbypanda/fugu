# Sakana Fugu

<img align="right" width="240" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d708e5f3-e9a5-47a2-886f-5cd94e0b5657" alt="Sakana Fugu">

[Sakana Fugu](https://sakana.ai/fugu/) is a multi-agent system delivered as one model. Fugu dynamically orchestrates frontier models to tackle complex, multi-step tasks. You can access the multi-agent system as a single LLM through the [Sakana API](https://console.sakana.ai/get-started), which supports both Chat Completions and Responses endpoints.

To quickly get started, you can install Fugu into Codex with a single command:
  
```bash
curl -fsSL https://sakana.ai/fugu/install | bash
```

Then launch it with:

```bash
codex-fugu
```

See the [command reference](docs/commands_details.md) for additional flags and options. The one-line install supports Ubuntu and macOS. On Windows, or if the install does not complete, follow the guide [here](https://console.sakana.ai/get-started#manually-setting-up-codex).

## Superior performance via intelligent coordination

Sakana Fugu achieves superior performance by dynamically coordinating and orchestrating a diverse pool of powerful models. For evaluation details, check [our technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.21228).

These results reflect our June 2026 evaluation. As new frontier models are released, we continuously update our model pool and retrain our coordinators to maintain Fugu's performance advantage.

## Sakana Fugu in action

These examples compare Sakana Fugu models with three frontier baselines: Gemini 3.1 Pro (high), Opus 4.8 (max), and GPT 5.5 (xhigh). To keep the focus on behavior rather than brand-by-brand attribution, the baselines are anonymized as Model A, Model B, and Model C in each description. The mapping is intentionally not fixed across examples.

## Our research

Sakana Fugu is based on two papers published in ICLR 2026.

Since publication, we have made several enhancements. The full technical report is available [here](Fugu_technical_report.pdf).
